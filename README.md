# Basics_GitHub_Pages
Building a basic template for deploying a static website using GitHub Pages.

# Steps

* Create a new repository on GitHub:
* Create a new branch called "gh-pages" (or other name):
  - Click on the **"Branch: main"** button (or whatever your default branch is named) on the left-hand side of the screen.
  - Type "gh-pages" into the **"Create a new branch"** field.
  - Click the **"Create branch: gh-pages"** button.

* Upload the website files to the repository:
  - index.html
  - styles.css
  - scripts.js
  - images (folder)
 
* Commit the changes to the "gh-pages" branch using Git.
* Configure the repository settings:
  - Go to your repository settings by clicking on the **"Settings"** tab.
  - Scroll down to the **"GitHub Pages"** section.
  - In the **"Source"** dropdown menu, select "gh-pages branch".
  - Click the **"Save"** button.

* Verify your deployment:
  - Wait a few minutes for your website to be deployed. You should see a message that says **"Your site is ready to be published at https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name/"**.
  - Click on the link to make sure your website is working.
  
**That's it!** Your website should now be live and accessible at the URL provided by GitHub Pages.

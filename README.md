# Basics_GitHub_Pages
Building a basic template for deploying a static website using GitHub Pages.

### Note: All the files that Im using comes from my Final Proyect for the "Data Analytics and visualization" Bootcamp of Tec de Monterrey. The Final Proyect "Presidential Elections in the US (2000-2020): the ideology behind the citizen vote" was built by the ElectionTeam2022.

# Steps

* Create a new repository on GitHub:
* Create a new branch called "gh-pages" (or other name):
  - Click on the **"Branch: main"** button (or whatever your default branch is named) on the left-hand side of the screen.
  - Type "gh-pages" into the **"Create a new branch"** field.
  - Click the **"Create branch: gh-pages"** button.

* Upload the website files to the repository:
  - index.html
  - styles.css
  - scripts.js
  - images (folder)

 
* Commit the changes to the "gh-pages" branch using Git.
* Configure the repository settings:
  - Go to your repository settings by clicking on the **"Settings"** tab.
  - Scroll down to the **"Pages"** section.
  - In the **"Source"** dropdown menu, select **"gh-pages branch"** and select **"docs"**.
  - Click the **"Save"** button.

* Verify your deployment:
  - Wait a few minutes for your website to be deployed. You should see a message that says **"Your site is ready to be published at https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name/"**.
  - Click on the link to make sure your website is working.
  
**That's it!** Your website should now be live and accessible at the URL provided by GitHub Pages.

* Now, you can go to your gh-page anytime by clicking the link below the **"Environments"** section, in the right side of the page. If everything is OK, you should see an **"Active"** status.

* In **"Deployments"** you can click **"View deployment"** and check the history of all the github pages you have done.
